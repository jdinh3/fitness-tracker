# fitness-tracker

## Description

This is a fitness tracker that allows a user to log their fitness routine and exercises. The user is able to log either a cardio or resistance exercise and the details of their workout. They can continue adding exercises to their workout, or press complete when they are done logging that workout session. The homepage displays the details of their last workout, and the dashboard shows the user's weekly workout stats.
